            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the KING of theſe Nations, THE HUMBLE REPRESENTATION OF Several SOCIETIES, commonly called by the Name of ANABAPTISTS, Where in ſhort they Declare their Innocency, Sufferings, Dcſires &amp; Reſolutions.</head>
            <p>WHereas, O King, there-have of late years happened in this Nation, many ſtrange Changes and Revolutions, to the great Amazement of the Sons of Men, by which moſt men of all Ranks and Qualities have been ſubject to Err; from which we cannot altogether Acquit our Selves; yet this we can boldly ſay, That although ſome of us were in Arms under the former Powers, our End was not the Deſtruction of mens lives, but rarher their Preſervation, and to prevent the rude Multitude of their Deſignes, which were no other then Ruine and Deſolation where they did prevail: This we ſay was our End, whatſoever our Adverſaries do ſay to our Reproach.</p>
            <p>And whereas, O King, there have (within theſe few Dayes) been in the City of <hi>London,</hi> very ſtrange and unheard of Actions, to the wounding of our Souls, we have been ſo far from Deſigning or Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein; that Envie it ſelf cannot juſtly Chargeus; Nevertheleſs ſuch is the Portion of many of us, to be taken out of our Houſes, and from our Employments, beaten and abuſed in the Streets by the rude Multitude, haled before the Juſtices &amp; other Officers, and then having nothing to Charge us with, they put to us the <hi>Oath,</hi> or <hi>Oaths,</hi> and upon Refuſal (though Chriſt hath Prohibited Swearing at all, eſpecially any Promiſary Oath) are we ſent to Priſon to the impoveriſhing and ruine of us, our Wives and Children; which Oppoſition againſt <hi>Swearing</hi> now in us, is no more then what the greateſt Part of us were againſt under the former Powers.</p>
            <p>But that which wounds us moſt, O King, is the late <hi>Proclamation,</hi> wherein there is no Difference made, but as though all were alike in the Tranſgreſſion, and had all made an ill uſe of thine Indulgence, and forfeited our Liberty, which doth ſtrengthen the rude Multitude in their Confidence, That we are Guilty of ſome Pernicious Deſign againſt Thee, O King, and the Nation; which falſe Report greatly obſtruct our Liberties to Meet together to Pray and Edifie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as alſo to Meet in our own Houſes to Pray one with another, which we humbly conceive is our Right as Men and Chriſtians; which if we do, we are lyable to be deſtroyed by the rude Multitude, though we cannot be Charged with any Fact: Thus the Guiltleſs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with the Guilty, which is averſe to the Mind of the Holy and Juſt God.</p>
            <p>And although our Conſciences do bear us witneſs, that we have not abuſed our Liberty by any ill uſe that we have made of Thine Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and that <hi>Thy Proclamation</hi> (Prohibiting our Aſſembling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether after our uſual manner) do not properly reach us, but that we ought to have had the benefit of <hi>Thy former Declaration</hi> aſcertaining our Chriſtian Freedom; Yet for as much as the late Diſturbance might miniſter Cauſe of Jealouſie, being done by ſome that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Separation,</hi> but not of our Faith or Practice, ſuch of us as have not been Impriſoned, have ſince <hi>Thy Proclamation</hi> was extant, forborn to Meet, leſt it ſhould be judg'd Contempt of Authority: So willing we are to prevent all Grounds of Fear: And we do Challenge the World, to come forth and ſhew wherein we have offended Thee that we are thus dealt with; for we can truly ſay with the Servant-of God of old, <hi>That Innocency is found in us, and againſt Thee, O King, have we done no harm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, O King, our humble Deſire is, That Thou wouldeſt ſeriouſly weigh our Innocency and Sufferings with our humble deſires, as alſo our forbearance to Aſſemble (leaſt it ſhould be deemed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt) until we had Cleared our Innocency unto Thee, which here (in the Fear of the All-ſeeing God) we have done: And if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our juſt Complaint, Thine Ears be ſhut againſt our Cry, and will not Releaſe the Innocent out of Priſon, nor Reſtore our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty, which of late we have been deprived of without juſt Cauſe; but upon miſ-information, and ſhall ſtill be lyable to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the rude Multitude, that then we ſhall caſt all our Care upon our God, and Aſſemble together to Pray, and build up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the things of our Holy God, as he hath commanded us, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thee, O King, and all the World to judge, Whether we ought not to obey God rather then Man: And if for ſerving our God Thou ſuffereſt us to be Deſtroyed, we ſhall commit our Righteous Cauſe to him that Judgeth righteouſly, and hath ſaid, <hi>Vengeance is mine and I will repay it,</hi> Rom. 12. 19. In the mean time we ſhall patiently wait, and mightily Cry unto the Lord, until he Redeem us from the hands of our Oppreſſours: For the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>He will Encamp about his Houſe, and no Oppreſſours ſhall paſs through them any more; for now have I ſeen with mine eyes, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Zach. 9. 8. All which, O King, we ſhall commit to Thy Conſideration, and ſhall be ſubject to Thee in Civil things for Conſcience ſake; and Subſcribe our Names for our Selves, and the Congregation to which we do belong.</p>
